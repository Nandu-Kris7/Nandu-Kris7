Hi, I’m Nandu Krishna Raji Mol (He/Him) — currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Engineering @ CSUN.

I’m focused on Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Engineering, and Applied AI — especially where models have to survive the real world (messy data, constraints, performance, deployment… all the fun stuff).
I enjoy building end-to-end systems: raw data → clean pipelines → feature engineering → model training/evaluation → deployment + monitoring.

🚀 What I’m working on

🤖 Machine Learning: supervised/unsupervised learning, deep learning foundations

🧱 Data Engineering: ETL/ELT, data modeling, scalable pipelines

⚙️ Applied AI: evaluation, inference optimization, real-time constraints

🔌 Hardware edge: microcontrollers, embedded programming, VHDL (useful when AI runs close to devices)

🤝 Open to collaborations

ML/AI projects with real datasets and measurable outcomes

Data pipelines/platforms for analytics or ML

AI-powered systems in robotics / IoT / edge applications

📩 If you’re building something where data turns into decisions, let’s connect.
