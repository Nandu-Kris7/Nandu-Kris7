 Hi, I’m Nandu Krishna Raji Mol (He/Him) — currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Engineering at CSUN.

I’m focused on Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Engineering, and Applied AI — especially where models have to survive the real world (messy data, constraints, performance, deployment… all the fun stuff).
I enjoy building end-to-end systems: turning raw data into clean pipelines, engineering features, training and evaluating models, and pushing them toward deployment with monitoring and iteration.

What I’m working on:
Machine Learning: supervised/unsupervised learning, deep learning foundations
Data Engineering: ETL/ELT, data modeling, scalable pipelines
Applied AI: evaluation, inference optimization, real-time constraints
Hardware edge: microcontrollers, embedded programming, VHDL (useful when AI runs close to devices)
Open to collaborations in ML/AI, data pipelines/platforms, and AI-powered systems, and robotics.

If you’re building something where data turns into decisions, let’s connect.
